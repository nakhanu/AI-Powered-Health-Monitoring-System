# 🧠 AI-Powered Health Monitoring & Early Warning System

> A machine learning project to detect early signs of illness using synthetic biometric data, aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In many communities around the world, especially in underserved and remote areas, early detection of health risks is limited due to lack of access to preventive healthcare systems. This AI-powered system aims to monitor vital signs such as heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation to detect early anomalies like fever, fatigue, or breathing difficulties — and provide real-time alerts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Simulate realistic, labeled health monitoring data (heart rate, temperature, SpO2).
- ✅ Detect anomalies such as fever, elevated heart rate, and oxygen drops.
- ✅ Train an ML model to classify or flag health risks.
- ✅ Display the data and predictions via an interactive web dashboard.
- ✅ Promote low-cost, scalable healthcare technology aligned with SDG 3 & 9.

## 🌍 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Alignment

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **SDG 3** | Good Health and Well-being — enable early detection and prevention of illness. |
| **SDG 9** | Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure — build scalable, affordable digital healthcare tools. |

## 🗃️ Dataset



## 🧠 AI & Modeling Approach

### Model Options:
- **Option 1**: Supervised classification (Random Forest / MLP)
- **Option 2**: LSTM-based anomaly detection
- **Option 3**: Hybrid approach for time-series with activity context

### Data Pipeline:
1. Preprocessing: scaling, encoding activity, creating time windows
2. Feature engineering: rolling averages, circadian adjustments
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Deployment to an interactive app (Streamlit or Flask)

## 🧪 Ethical Considerations
Concern	Mitigation
🔐 Data Privacy	Dataset is synthetic and anonymized
⚖️ Bias	Includes 3 user profiles with variable baselines
🌐 Accessibility	Designed for lightweight deployment (low compute & mobile compatible)
⚠️ False Alerts	Thresholds fine-tuned using labeled events

## 🛠️ Future Work
 Integrate with wearable API (Fitbit, Apple HealthKit)

 Add geolocation + real-world symptom logging

 Train on real-world datasets (WESAD, PAMAP2)

 Expand health condition classes (dehydration, sleep apnea, etc.)

 Host model on cloud (e.g., Hugging Face or AWS Lambda)
